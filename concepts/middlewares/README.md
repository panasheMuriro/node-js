# Middlewares in Express.js
In Express.js, middleware is a function that executes during the lifecycle of a request to the server. Middleware functions can modify the request and response objects or terminate the request-response cycle.

## Types of Middleware
- Built-in Middleware: Comes with Express (e.g., express.json(), express.static()).
- Third-party Middleware: Installed via npm (e.g., cors, body-parser).
- Custom Middleware: Defined by you to handle specific tasks.
